/** Program which execution results in value of type `A` or fails with exception.
  *
  * We call a program which execution results in a value of type `A` as _normal_, a program
  * which execution ends with exception as _failed_ or _raised_.
  *
  * WARNING: Execution of program may involve side effects, so the same program may once end
  * normally and once fail, so "normal" or "raised" is not an inherent property of program,
  * but relates to its execution. Nevertheless, we colloquially say "failed program" for
  * "program we executed and got failure". Is is necessary to keep this distinction in mind.
  *
  * Production ready IO would provide:
  *   - more control of execution fairness,
  *   - support for work with time,
  *   - possibility to opt-in to features,
  *   - execution on multiple thread,
  *   - support for working with blocking operations,
  *   - fibers (green threads),
  *   - and more.
